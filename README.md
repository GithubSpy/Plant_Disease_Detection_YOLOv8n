# Plant Disease Detection YOLOv8n --- Gradio Project

I have downloaded the dataset for model training from [Roboflow Biodome](https://universe.roboflow.com/montclair/biodome). The model was trained using Ultralytics YOLOv8 for 50 epochs. I have uploaded all validation results, including a Jupyter Notebook file, to my GitHub repository. Additionally, I have developed a Gradio interface for the model and deployed it on Hugging Face Spaces.

Here are the details of the dataset:

Number of images in each folder:
  Train: 53,209
  Test: 6,375
  Validation: 6,614
